# Linked Lists in C++

This repository contains implementations of several types of linked lists in C++ language.

## Files

- `Queued_Linked_List.cpp`: Implementation of a Queue using a linked list, which works on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

- `Circular_Linked_List.cpp`: Implementation of a Circular Linked List, which is a linked list where the last node points back to the first node.

- `Doubly_Linked_List.cpp`: Implementation of a Doubly Linked List, which is a linked list where each node has a pointer to the next node and the previous node.

- `Singly_Linked_List.cpp`: Implementation of a Singly Linked List, which is a linked list where each node has a pointer to the next node.

- `Stacked_Linked_List.cpp`: Implementation of a Stack using a linked list, which works on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

## Usage

Each file contains a `main()` function that demonstrates how to use the corresponding linked list implementation. To run the program, open the C++ file in your compiler and build and run the program. The program will demonstrate the usage of the linked list implementation.
